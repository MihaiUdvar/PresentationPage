        <div class="aboutMe">
            <p>I was born in Romania and after finishing my engineering studies, I cycled to Norway and lived here ever since. After many years of working in the oil industry I decided to follow my passion for technology and study web-development. <br> <br> The long path to reconversion started with an intensive course of front-end web development(javascript) that is due to finish in march 2021. <br><br> In my fee time I am a keen outdoors person with a lifetime passion for bicycles, mountaineering and camping.
